# Abstract 

Most descriptions surrounding the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frances Arnold, Sir Gregory Winter, and George Smith --- for directed evolution and phage display --- have focused on the present‚Äêday applied benefits derived from directing evolutionary processes toward humanity's ends. Delightfully, that is not the whole story: we have also learned much about natural evolution through the attempts to direct it.
